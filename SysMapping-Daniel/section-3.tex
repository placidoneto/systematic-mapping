\section{Systematic Mapping process}

We applied the systematic mapping methodology presented in~\cite{SM:Petersen:2008} to our study on SLA-guided data integration on a multi-cloud environments. 
The proposed methodology consists in five steps (in which step has a result and the final one is the mapping):

\begin{description}
\item \textbf{Definition of research question} to define the \textit{research scope};
\item \textbf{Conduct search} in order to retrieve \textit{all candidate papers}. Those papers are selected applying a query which express the research interest to scientific databases;
\item  \textbf{Screening of papers} to select the \textit{relevant papers} to answer the research question based on a inclusion and exclusion criteria;
\item \textbf{Keywording using abstracts} to identify terms that helps on developing the \textit{classification scheme} (mapping categories to classify the papers); and
\item \textbf{Data extraction and mapping process} to sort the relevant papers into the mapping categories and produce the systematic mapping.
\end{description}

\bigskip The following subsections describes our first to fourth step in the
mapping. The systematic mapping results are presented in the next section.   
 
\subsection{Definition of research questions (RQs)}
The aim of this work is to identify in the literature how has \textit{SLA-guided
data integration on a multi-cloud environments} been explored, discover possible
gaps and the main results produced.    
In order to achieve this goal we formulated three research questions:
\begin{description}
\item \textbf{Which are the SLA measures that have been applied most in the cloud?}
\item \textbf{How has the publication of papers on data integration involved towards cloud topics?}
\item \textbf{How and in which context have data integration guided by QoS models or requirements been explored in the literature?}
\end{description}

\subsection{Search and screening of papers}
\textcolor{red}{search string...}

\textcolor{red}{inclusion and exclusion criteria...}

Inclusion: The title and the abstract mention (i) approach using SLA which includes (or doesn't) data integration; (ii) any study regarding SLA in the context of cloud computing (I saw that there are some works on voip services. I believe this is out of our scope) or some improvement to SLA; (iii) data integration in the context of cloud computing; and (iv) QoS efforts regarding data integration;

A new version of our exclusion criteria:

Papers, books and others that the subject do not focus on the following topics must be excluded:
(i) an approach combining SLA, data integration and cloud and multi-cloud;
(ii) an approach using SLA contracts in the context of cloud and multi-cloud;
(iii) an approach applying some improvement to SLA;
(iv) a data integration approach in the context of cloud and multi-cloud; and
(v) a QoS approach regarding data integration.
