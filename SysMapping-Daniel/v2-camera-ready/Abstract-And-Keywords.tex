This paper  identifies trends and open issues regarding the use of
SLA in data integration solutions on multi-cloud environments.   
Therefore it presents results of  a Systematic Mapping \cite{SM:Petersen:2008} 
 that analyzes the way SLA, data integration and multi-cloud environments are correlated in existing works. The main result is a classification scheme consisting of facets and dimensions namely (i)
data integration environment (cloud; data warehouse; federated database;
multi-cloud); (ii) data integration description (knowledge; metadata; schema); and (iii) data quality (confidentiality; privacy; security; SLA; data protection; data provenance). The proposed classification scheme is used to organize a collection of representative papers and discuss the numerical  analysis about research trends in the domain.
