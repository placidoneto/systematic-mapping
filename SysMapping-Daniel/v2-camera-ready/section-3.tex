The aim of our bibliographic study using the systematic mapping methodology \cite{SM:Petersen:2008} is to (i) categorize and quantify the key contributions and the evolution of the research done on \textit{SLA-guided
data integration in a multi-cloud environment} and  (ii) discover open issues and limitations of existing works.    
Our study is guided by  three research questions:


\textit{\textbf{RQ1:} Which are the SLA measures that have been mostly
applied  in the cloud?} This question  identifies  the type of
properties used for characterizing and evaluating the services provided  by
different clouds.   
 
\textit{\textbf{RQ2:}  How have published papers on data
 integration evolved towards cloud topics?} This question is devoted to identify the way  data integration problems addressed in the literature started  to include issues introduced by the cloud.

\textit{\textbf{RQ3:} In which way and in which  context has data integration  been linked to Quality of Service (QoS) measures in the literature?} The objective of this question is to understand which QoS measures have been used for evaluating data integration and to determine the conditions in which  specific measures are particularly used.

\subsection{Searching and screening  papers} \label{subsec:search}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to our research questions and our expertise in data integration we chose a set of keywords to define a complex query to be used for retrieving papers from four target publication databases: IEEE~\footnote{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/},
ACM~\footnote{http://dl.acm.org/}, Science Direct~\footnote{http://www.sciencedirect.com/} and
CiteSeerX~\footnote{http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/}. We used the following conjunctive and disjunctive general query which was completed with associated terms from a thesaurus and rewritten according to the expression rules of advanced queries in each database: 




\begin{center}
\textit{("Service level agreement"  AND ("Data integration" OR "Database
integration") AND ("Cloud" OR "Multi-cloud "))} \\
\end{center}
\medskip  

We retrieved  a total of 1832 publications. As a result of the filtering process
proposed by the systematic mapping methodology~\cite{SM:Petersen:2008} we excluded 1718 publications.
The number of papers included for building the final collection were 114
publications~\footnote{List of references available in:

\subsection{Defining classification facets}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We analyzed the titles and abstracts of the  papers derived in the previous
phase using information retrieval techniques  to identify  frequent
 terms. We used these terms for proposing a classification scheme
consisting of three facets that group dimensions. The following lines define the facets and dimensions of the
classification scheme we propose. 

%.  -   .  .  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   .  
\textbf{\textit{Data Integration Environment:}}  
%.  -   .  .  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   .  
This facet groups the dimensions that characterize the architectures used for delivering data integration services ({\em data warehouse} and  {\em federated database}) and  architectures used for deploying these services ({\em cloud} and {\em multi-cloud}).

%.  -   .  .  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   .  
\textbf{\textit{Data Integration Description:}}
%.  -   .  .  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   .  
 This facet groups the dimensions describing the approaches used for describing the databases content in order to  integrate them. Data integration can be done by using {\em meta-data, schema}, and {\em knowledge}.

%.  -   .  .  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   .  
\textbf{\textit{Data Quality:}} 
%.  -   .  .  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   ..  -   .  
This facet groups the dimensions  representing data quality measures. Measures can be related directly to data for instance {\em confidentiality, privacy, security, protection and provenance} and to the conditions in which data is integrated and delivered  (i.e., dimension {\em SLA}).           

The original vision of our classification scheme is that of adding the notion of {\em quality} to data integration represented by the facets {\em data quality}
and  {\em SLA}.
With these facets our classification scheme shows the aspects that must be considered when addressing data integration in the cloud  taking into account (i) the quality of data, (ii) the systems that integrate data and (iii) the quality warranties that a data consumer can expect expressed in SLAs.

\section{Quantitative Analysis}\label{sec:qanalysis}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------% 

This section discusses the quantitative analysis  presented in bubble charts that combine different facets. 
In order to observe the evolution of the publication trends we defined a time screen between the years 1998 and 2014 (see Figure \ref{fig:pubperyear}). SLA has emerged when Cloud issues started to be addressed around 2009. The number of publications has increased as cloud infrastructures have become more popular and accessible. It seems  that data integration is an open issue when it is combined with SLA and cloud trends. Less recent papers seem to be devoted to the way data is described under schemata or knowledge representation strategies. This could be due to the fact that these strategies are consolidated today and  to the emergence of NoSQL approaches with their schema-less philosophy \cite{sadalage2012nosql}.

We combined facets for answering the research questions proposed for guiding our
study. The following lines discuss the answers.

The facets SLA expression, data integration description and contribution give elements for determining which SLA measures have been applied to the cloud (Figure~\ref{fig:facet1}). 
The resulting bubble chart shows that most contributions propose SLA models and that  \textit{privacy}
and \textit{security} (11 papers - 9.65\%) are the most popular measures considered by SLA models for the cloud. These measures concern the network, information, data protection and confidentiality in the cloud. Most contributions propose SLA models (53 papers - 46.49\%)  but some languages (8 papers - 7.02\%) have also emerged. {\em Data provenance} is also a measure that emerges but only in papers dealing with multi-cloud environments. Data integration is merely addressed by using schemata (12 papers - 10.53\%)  and meta-data (4 papers - 3.51\%) particularly through models (34 papers - 29.82\%) and tools (25 papers - 21.93\%). Still, some works propose surveys (8 papers - 7.02\%).

\end{figure}

Combining the facets data integration environment, contribution
and research it is possible to observe  the evolution of publications on data integration towards the cloud (Figure~\ref{fig:facet2}).  {\em Data warehouse} environments are the most common architecture. This can be explained by the increase of scientific  and industrial applications needing to build integrated  data sets for performing analysis and decision making tasks. The proposals are delivered as {\em models}  (14  papers - 12.27\%)  and {\em tools} (18
papers - 15.78\%)  used for facilitating data integration, mostly done in the {\em cloud}.  The most popular deployment environment of recent papers is the {\em cloud}. Given the importance and crucial need of data integration  most papers present concrete solutions as algorithms, methods and systems (31 papers - 27.19\%).

\caption{Facets Data Quality, Data Integration Environment and Data Integration Description}\label{fig:facet4}
\end{figure}

We answered RQ3 by combining the facet {\em data quality} with the facets {\em data integration environment} and {\em data integration description}
(Figure~\ref{fig:facet4}).  Data integration and QoS measures are associated within environments like cloud  (9.68\%) and multi-cloud (4.39\%).

According to our quantitative analysis we observe that QoS has started to be
considered for integrating data. 
 The cloud is becoming a popular environment to
perform data integration in which security issues are most frequently addressed.
We identify a promising research area concerning the need of studying SLA which
is currently addressed  for the cloud as a whole \cite{PedrinaciCL14} but that
needs to be specialized for data integration aspects. Therefore, it is important
to identify the measures that characterize the quality of data and  the
quality measures associated to different phases of data integration. These phases include selecting
data services, retrieving data, integrating and correlating them and building a
query result that can be eventually stored and that must be delivered. The data integration phases are implemented by greedy algorithms and generate intermediate data that
can be stored for further use. Therefore they consume storage, computing,
processing and communication resources that have an associated economic cost. These resources 
 must ensure some QoS guarantees to data consumers. This problem seems to be
open in the domain, and we believe that it must be part of  a new vision of data
integration. We believe that it is possible to add and enhance the quality of
data integration by including SLAs.
