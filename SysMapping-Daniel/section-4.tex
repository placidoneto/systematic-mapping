\section{Results: Quantitative Analysis}\label{sec:qanalysis}

This section shows the analysis and discussion of our Systematic Mapping results.
We proceed by presenting bubble charts as result of combining different facets in order to 
\textit{(i)} answer the research questions and \textit{(ii)} to justify our proposal.

% \subsection{Quantitative Analysis}


Our analysis presents the frequencies of publications for
the choosen facets. The charts show the aggregated view of the number of papers 
considering the facets. This approach will help answer the three research
questions more objectively.
% Despite the low number of works tackling other publishers, they maintain their
% presence over the years, mainly between 2008-2014. IEEE and ACM are the publishers
% that most published papers related to service-oriented applications considering
% non-functional properties. Considering Elsevier, we can found papers only from 2008.
% Figure 1a presents the publications for each publisher per year.

\subsection{\textit{RQ1: Which are the SLA measures that have been applied most in
the cloud?}}

Considering SLA measures, the ones that are most applied are \textit{privacy}
and \textit{security}. As a cloud environment evolves computer
security, network security and also information security, it is necessary
a set of policies and technologies to protect data. Based on the analysed works,
\textit{privacy} and \textit{security} appeared more often as SLA contribution
for cloud application. From these works, most of the contributions propose new
models to represent SLA. There are other authors which consider
\textit{confidentiality} and \textit{data protection} on the cloud. In the other
hand, \textit{data provenace} is only consider in multi-cloud environment.
The combined analysis of Figures \ref{fig:facet1} and \ref{fig:facet4} answer
this question, as we present following.

The benefit of cloud is shared resources, which is supported by a shared
infrastructure environment. From this, SLA can cover the whole cloud environment
as a service based agreement rather than a customer based agreement. Thus, the
increased focus on \textit{privacy} and \textit{security} is essential for
better sharing resources on the cloud.

\includegraphics[scale=0.56]{figs/bubble-charts/Contribution-SLA-DIdescription.pdf} 
\caption{Contribution, SLA and Data Integration Description}\label{fig:facet1}
\end{figure}

Combining the facet contribution with the facets SLA and data integration description 
(Figure~\ref{fig:facet1}) it is possible to obtain two analysis: 
(i) how the SLA has been applied to scientific works and which are the type of contribution 
most proposed by the authors; and (ii) which are the most applied data integration description
strategy in papers and which are the most type of contribution associated to these works. 

The most used type of environment is \textit{cloud}, followed by \textit{data
warehouse, multi-cloud} and \textit{federated database}. Looking to the figure
you can alse note that models for SLA have been the focus in the papers (53 appearances - 46.49\%) followed by Security (11 appearances - 9.65\%), Language 
(8 appearances - 7.02\%) and Resources (3 appearances - 22.83\%).
Analyzing the figure is also possible to observe that Model (34 appearances - 29.82\%) and 
Tool (25 appearances - 21.93\%) are the mainly type of contribution proposed in the papers 
followed by Literature Analysis (8 appearances - 7.02\%), Process (4 appearances - 3.51\%), 
Method (3 appearances - 2.63\%) and Extended Study (1 appearance - 0.88\%).

Regarding the data integration description, Schema (12 appearances - 10.53\%) is
the most applied dimension followed by Metadata (4 appearances - 3.51\%) and
Knowledge (1 appearance - 0.88\%).

The limitation of cloud applications, considering SLAs, is the difficulty in
determining main reason for service interruptions due to the complex of
the environment. Even so, there are few works that consider \textit{data
protection} in such cases. One of the challenges of apply SLA in cloud
environments is to find the specific need of the application, so as to attack
the solution (\textit{security, privacy, confidentiality, data protection} or
\textit{data provenace}) in a objectively way, by proposing SLA models, methods,
or even new tools.



\subsection{\textit{RQ2: How has the publication of papers on data integration
involved towards cloud topics?}}

Most papers analysed consider as solution for data integration environment, the
cloud. A few others consider \textit{data warehouse}, \textit{muiti-cloud} and
\textit{federated database}. After the cloud, the data integration environment
most used is \textit{federated database}. With the rise of the cloud computing
environment and applications, there is a need of more data integration
solutions. As cloud becomes more centered in tecnological infraestructure, the
challenge of integrating data on the cloud rises as well. 

The contributions are diverse in respect of \textit{data integration} on the
cloud environment. There are many contributions based \textit{tool} solutions,
which is the most frequent considering the analyzed studies. The
proposed \textit{tools} used to assist the integration of data in the cloud.
The new proposals for models and methods are quite frequent. So, resembling the
use of SLA in the cloud, proposed solutions that consider data integration and
cloud go in the same direction, new models, methods and tools. The combined
analysis of Figures \ref{fig:facet2} and \ref{fig:facet4} answer this question,
as we present following.


A few other studies do literature review comparing work and presenting
gaps in relation to these two areas. Considering Figure \ref{fig:facet2}, you
can verify that most research types presented are new solutions. Others few show validation
and evaluation ana;lysis of existing proposals.

\end{figure}

Combining the facet data integration environment with the facets contribution
and research it is possible to observe which are the most proposed type of
contribution and research applied to data integration towards cloud topics. 
Looking to the Figure ~\ref{fig:facet2} it is possible to identify that Tool (18
appearances - 15.78\%) and Model (14 appearance - 12.27\%) are the mainly type
of contribution developed, followed by Literature Analysis (8 appearances -
7.02\%), Method (5 appearances - 4.39\%) Process (2 appearances - 1.75\%) and
Extended Study (1 appearance - 0.88\%).
Analyzing the figure is also possible to observe that Solution (31 appearances -
27.19\%) is the type of research most proposed, followed by Evaluation (8
appearances - 7.02\%), Validation (5 appearances - 4.39\%) and Opinion (3
appearances - 2.63\%).
 
\subsection{\textit{RQ3: How and in which context have data integration guided
by QoS models or requirements been explored in the literature?}}

Combining the facet data quality with the facets data integration environment and data integration description
(Figure~\ref{fig:facet4}) it is possible to verify how and in which context
quality of service parameters have been explored and applied most in data
integration studies. It is also possible to identify which are the most applied
data integration environment and description.

First of all, \textit{security} and \textit{privacy} are the most applied QoS
parameter (5 appearance - 4.39\%) followed by the other dimensions (1 appearance - 0.88\%). 
The figure also shows that SLA has not been widely used in order to address data integration solutions
(1 appearance) which reinforces our main objective of integrate SLA, data integration and multi-cloud 
environments. 
Analyzing the figure is also possible to observe that the most deployed data integration environment is 
the cloud (9.68\%) followed by multi-cloud (4.39\%), federated databases (1.75\%) and data warehouse (0.00\%).
The data integration description dimensions had the same percentage for schema, knowledge and metadata (2 appearance - 1.75\%)

% Most data integration environment consider cloud for solution. 
% 
% The type of contribution envolving data integration most often are
% \textit{tools} and \textit{models}, respectively. Some few others focus on the
% proposition of \textit{methods} or \textit{process}.
