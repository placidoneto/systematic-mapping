@inproceedings{071,
abstract = {Cost and scalability benefits of Cloud storage services are apparent. However, selecting a single storage service provider limits availability and scalability to the selected provider and may further cause a vendor lock-in effect. In this paper, we present MetaStorage, a federated Cloud storage system that can integrate diverse Cloud storage providers. MetaStorage is a highly available and scalable distributed hash table that replicates data on top of diverse storage services. MetaStorage reuses mechanisms from Amazon's Dynamo for cross-provider replication and hence introduces a novel approach to manage consistency-latency tradeoffs by extending the traditional quorum (N,R,W) configurations to an (N\_P,R,W) scheme that includes different providers as an additional dimension. With MetaStorage, new means to control consistency-latency tradeoffs are introduced.},

abstract = {Ontologies are often used to achieve interoperability between the nodes in the grid and the cloud. At present, most ontologies are built manually by the experts in the field. A new method aiming at ontology learning based on relational database is proposed. By analyzing the schema of relational database, a group of rules of transition from relational schema to OWL are established. Then a framework for extracting ontology from relational database is proposed. Based on the above work, a heterogeneous data integration based semantic prototype system is designed and implemented. Finally, strong and firm support to applications has been provided.},
