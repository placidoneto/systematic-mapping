%This section contains the background necessary to develop the research.
Our work can be compared with works concerning  two different lines of research:
\textit{(i)} data integration on a multi-cloud environment; and
\textit{(ii)} service level agreements and data integration.

%There are two different lines of research interesting to the proposal:

\subsection{Data integration on multi-cloud environment}
As shown in our classification scheme data integration description is a major topic. Recent works address knowledge oriented approaches for addressing the problem. For example, ~\cite{075} proposes a  query rewriting method for achieving RDF data integration
using SPARQL. The principle of the approach is to rewrite the RDF graph pattern of the query using data manipulation functions in order to: (i) solve 
the entity co-reference problem which can lead to ineffective data integration; 
and (ii) exploit ontology alignments with a particular interest in data manipulation. 
~\cite{078} introduces the  Service 
Oriented Data Integration based on MapReduce  system (SODIM)  which combines data integration,
service oriented architecture and distributed processing. SODIM works on a pool of collaborative services and 
processes a large number of databases represented as web services. 
~\cite{YauY08} introduces a data integration approach focussing on data privacy.
They propose a privacy preserving repository in order to integrate data from
different data  services. 
Based on users' integration requirements, the repository supports the retrieval and integration of
data across different services. Data security is supported bith on the repository and in the data  services.
~\cite{096} proposes an inter-cloud data integration system that considers a trade-off between users' privacy requirements and the cost for protecting and processing data.
According to the users' privacy requirements, the query plan  in the cloud repository 
creates the users' query. This query is subdivided into sub-queries that can
be  executed in  service providers or on a cloud repository .
Each option has it own charges for privacy and processing. 
Thus the query plan executor decides the best location to execute the sub-query
to meet privacy and cost constraints.

\subsection{Service level agreement and data integration}
Service level agreement (SLA) contracts have been widely adopted in the context of Cloud computing. Research contributions mainly concern (i) SLA negotiation phase (step in which the
contracts are established between customers and providers) and (ii)
monitoring and allocation of cloud resources to detect and avoid SLA
violations.

In the domain of data integration approaches ~\cite{Nie07} proposes a data integration model guided by SLAs in a Grid environment.
Their architecture is subdivided into four parts: (i) a \textit{SLA-based
Resource Description Model} that describes the database resources; (ii)
a \textit{SLA-based Query Model} that normalizes the different queries based on the
SLA information; (iii) an \textit{SLA-based Matching Algorithm}  
selects the databases and finally (iv) a \textit{SLA-based Evaluation Model}
 to obtain the final query solution.
Considering our previous work~\cite{012}, to the best of our knowledge, we have
not identified more proposals concerning the use of SLAs combined with a data
integration approach in multi-cloud context.
