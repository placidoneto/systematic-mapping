The aim of this paper is to identify trends and open issues regarding the use of service level agreements
associated with data integration solutions on multi-cloud environments.
We performed a Systematic Mapping \cite{SM:Petersen:2008} concerning these topics in order to
analyze the way in which the topics are correlated.
We searched and retrieved scientific production on this subject. 
Then, we also classified the results according to five facets: (i) data
integration environment (cloud; data warehouse; federated database; multi-cloud); (ii) data integration description 
(knowledge; metadata; schema); (iii) data quality (confidentiality; privacy; security; SLA; data protection; data provenance; others); (iv) contribution (tool; literature analysis; model; method; process; extended study); 
and (v) research (evaluation; validation; opinion; solution). 
Based on this classification, we combined the facets and our results were expressed as bubble charts.
