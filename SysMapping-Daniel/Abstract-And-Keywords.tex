The aim of this paper is to identify trends and open issues regarding the use of
SLA associated with data integration solutions on multi-cloud environments.
SLA demonstrated interests in data analysis but has not been yet enough
considered on data integration. Therefore, we believe in the benefits of
SLA-based data integration in meeting better user requirement.   
To reach the target, we performed a Systematic Mapping \cite{SM:Petersen:2008} 
concerning the aforementioned topics in order to analyze the way in which they
are correlated. To do so, after  retrieving scientific productions on the
subject, a classification of the results has been done according to several facets. In this paper, we have considered a subset of them: (i)
data integration environment (cloud; data warehouse; federated database;
multi-cloud); (ii) data integration description (knowledge; metadata; schema); and (iii) data quality (confidentiality; privacy; security; SLA; data protection; data provenance; others). We combine the facets then expressed and analyzed the results as bubble
charts. Finally, we introduce a preliminary SLA-guided data integration in the multi-could context.
